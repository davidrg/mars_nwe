!! this kernelpatch is _not_ needed for kernel >= 1.3.60 :)  !!

this kernelpatch for clean kernels 1.3.56,57,58, pur 59 makes 3 things.

- removes the ipx-send bug. BIG THANKS to Volker Lendecke.
  the problem was that sometimes the sendto function hung.

- ipx rip/sap packets comming from internal net must change
  there source address from internal net/node to the
  device net/node.
  The problem was:
  By configuring mars_nwe at the internal network, the rip/sap
  socket gets the network and node address of the internal
  net. Then, by sending rip/sap packets over this socket to the
  several devices the rip/sap packets don't have the device net/node,
  but the internal net/node.

- an existing route should never be overwritten by an route
  over the internal net.
  The problem was:
  By running dosemu at the same workstation as mars_nwe the
  dosemu automaticly changes the route to a nearby server
  to route over the internal network and this destroyed
  the real route over a device to this server.

You must be supervisor and then you must start './patchme' .

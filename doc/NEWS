- New switch in config.h: QUOTA_SUPPORT
- quota support added by Matt Paley
  Before the netware quotas will work the linux quota system must be
  started up, this is done by:
  Ensuring that the current kernel supports quotas.
  Adding usrquota to the option field in the appropriate /etc/fstab entry
  Running 'quotacheck -a'
  Running 'quotaon -a' (must be repeated after a reboot)
- login time restrictions added by Matt Paley

  Section 8: special login/logout/security flags.
  Section 9: Standard creat mode for creating directories and files.
- file access now works with supplementary groups.
- simple station connect restrictions with nwserv.stations.
- and real bindery station login restrictions. (SYSCON)
------24-Aug-96--- 0.98.pl2 ----------
- 'PIPE' filesystem scheme changed. Now the first read or write
  calls the 'pipe program' and not the open or creat call.
  Therefore the first parameter is READ or WRITE and never CREAT!
  Also a pipe command may have two 'channels' (read and write).
  There is a little programpair comm.c/unxcomm.c in the
  examples directory  which explains the new scheme,
  by reading the code ;).
------30-Jul-96--- 0.98.pl1 ----------
- better OS2 name handling (upper/lowercase)
------22-Jul-96--- 0.98.pl0 ----------
- problems with directory handles eliminated.
  (missunderstood 'creat permanent directory handle' call :( )
- now poor OS/2 and NFS namespace added.
- dummy routine for OS/2 extended attributes.
  (OS/2 WP needs it)
------12-Jul-96--- 0.97.pl9 ----------
- better automatic handling of adding and removing
  of ipx-interfaces. (internal router)
- now running under linux/sparc.
- better file locking/sharing.
- some unix->dos attribute handling now.
- better read performance (mmap(ing)) config.h: USE_MMAP
- A not yet assigned mars_nwe user is now automatic assigned
  to a Linux user with same name when the password is changed and the
  new password is not null.
------------------ 0.97.pl7 ----------
Crypted Change password call implemented.
------05-May-96--- 0.97.pl3 ----------
Now nwserv can be called with parameter '-h' to send SIGHUP
to the main nwserv program or with '-k' to send SIGTERM
to the main nwserv program.

Updating utmp/wtmp files.

Automatic creat of ixp-interfaces in a NetWare
environment enabled.

Entry 1 for volumes enhanced.
Now you can make entries like:

1 HOME   ~    k   # Unixusers HOME

This means (path = '~') that this will be a volume
which allways point to the actual users homedir.
------21-Mar-96--- 0.97.pl2 ----------
Entry '7' in ini/conf file modified.
Old mode '8' is now mode '7' and mode '8'
is now extended by allowing empty mars_nwe passwords
although the linux password from this user is not empty.
-
Now mars_nwe works fine with OS/2 Client. :)
-
There is a new little kernelpatch 'kpatch1.3.72' in the
examples directory.
With this patch mars_nwe will speed up more than 30 %.

------10-Mar-96--- 0.97.pl0 ----------
New Conf-file entry '211' for broadcast periods.
Entries 400, 401 for special handling of the nearest server request.
-
Conf-file entry '6' enlarged.
-
New Entries '15' + '16' in conf-file.
With entry '15' you can allow mars_nwe insert all not yet known
users from /etc/passwd to mars_nwe bindery. But be carefully,
all new inserted users will get the same password from entry '15'.
-
If entry '16' is enabled ( '1' ) then mars_nwe will make some
checks for bindery and 'SYS:' directory.
For every user a MAIL/XXXXX dir will also be created.
-
Much more better bindery performance. :)
------13-Feb-96--- 0.96.pl9 ----------
New alternative password strategy in mars_nwe:
There is an new entry '7' in ini/conf file.

The user has now 4 ways to choose.
1. entry '7' = '0'.
   maximal security by forbid unencryted password calls,
   but till now no chance to modify passwords with client requests.

2. entry '7' = '1'.
   good security by only allow unencryted change password call.
   Here the user can use an old SETPAS or SYSCON program which
   make the changing of passwords with unencryted calls.

3. entry '7' = '8'.
   less security by allow all unencryted password calls.
   Like 2. but the user can also use old LOGIN program
   with unencryted passwords. Mars_nwe will allow password
   from the bindery and system-user-password.

4. entry '7' = '9'.
   Like 3. but in additional the routine 0x17 ufunc=0x17
   (get crypt key) will allways fail.
   So the LOGIN.EXE and SYSCON.EXE means that this is an old server
   with only unencrypted passwords and will switch to the old unencryted
   calls.

With the unencryted calls the clear passwords will go through the
wire, so mars_nwe can compare the passwords as well with the
stored bindery passwords as with the system passwords (crypt).
But there is a little hint. Passwords will ever be uppercase sent
from LOGIN.EXE or SYSCON.EXE
Mars_nwe makes three tries.
First try is with bindery-password, second try is with system
user-password and third try is making the password downcase and
compare with systen-user-password again.
When a user changes his password, only the bindery password will
be changed.

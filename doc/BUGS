If you have problems.
---------------------
- LOOK FOR KERNEL IPX CODE INSTALLED.
  CONFIG_IPX=y (or m and ipx modul loaded (insmod ipx)).
- Look for using NO 'full internal net'. (kernel switch)
  CONFIG_IPX_INTERN=n.
- Please always read doc/INSTALL[.ger], doc/README[.ger],
  doc/FAQS and examples/nw.ini.
  Very important sections in nwserv.conf(nw.ini) are:
  Section  1: volumes
  Section  3: Number of the internal network
  Section  4: IPX-devices
  Section  6: version-"spoofing"
  Section 12: supervisor-login
  If you do not have success, please make one try with
  the distributed config file(s) without changing it.
- Important NEWS are reported in doc/NEWS.
- set nwserv.conf debug switches 101 .. 10x to '1',
  make a new try with a new started nwserv and look
  into the log-file (/tmp/nw.log).
  Perhaps you can recognize the problem. :)

some short notes for problem- or bug-reports.
---------------------------------------------
- report your running environment
  full mars_nwe version, example: 0.98.pl5
  linux-kernel,                   2.0.23
  exact typ of client (NCPFS, DOS (NETX,VLM), OS/2, Win .. )
  changes you made into nwserv.conf(nw.ini), config.h.
- report whether your client runs correct under a 'real Novell-Server'.
  ( if you have one ;) )

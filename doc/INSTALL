=========>  !! important NOTE !!
You can configure mars_nwe in two ways.
1. You want mars_nwe to handle routing/sap and configuring
   ipx-interfaces. This is the default mode.
   You do not need any other ipx-tool or routers/daemons.
   In this modus the correct coexisting working
   of mars_nwe, dosemu, ncpfs or Caldera's nwclient was tested.
-> you must use kernel < 1.3.60 or use kernel >= 1.3.60 and compile
   your kernel with IPX-option CONFIG_IPX_INTERN=N
   In mars_nwe/config.h there must exist the following line:
   #define INTERNAL_RIP_SAP  1

2. You want to run mars_nwe only as a fileserver and use
   special tools to configure ipx and rip/sap routers.
-> In this mode you must use tools like ipx-configure and
   ripd to configure ipx-interfaces, routes and handle rip/sap.
   In mars_nwe/config.h there must exist the following line:
   #define INTERNAL_RIP_SAP  0

=========>   create programs
1. call make.
2. perhaps you must modify mk.li and config.h
3. call make

=========>   configure
modify nw.ini !
IMPORTANT !!
Please read examples/nw.ini if you use a new version
of mars_nwe and make the needed changes to your
'ini' or 'conf' file.
=========>   install
"make install"
"make install_ini" to overwrite your old _installed_ ini.

=========>   start programs
call nwserv ( as root !! )
tested with Linux Version 1.2.13 and 1.3.32
the linux-kernel must be configured with IPX=Y.
ipx-interface and ipx-routes are setup by the program if the
entry 4 (devices) in the nw.ini file is filled.

=========>   stop programs (server down)
If nwserv isn't daemonized, then the server can be stopped
with ^C, otherwise the server must be shut down with a
kill of nwserv or with the right dos client programm
(fconsole server down) as supervisor. Entry 210 in the
nw.ini file gives the time in seconds, before the server
really shuts down.

good luck  :-)

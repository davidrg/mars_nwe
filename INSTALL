=========>   create programs
1. call make.
2. perhaps you must modify mk.li and config.h
3. call make

=========>   configure
modify nw.ini !
IMPORTANT !!
Please read examples/nw.ini if you use a new version
of mars_nwe and make the needed changes to your
'ini' or 'conf' file.
=========>   install
"make install"
"make install_ini" to overwrite your old _installed_ ini.

=========>   start programs
call nwserv ( as root !! )
tested with Linux Version 1.2.13 and 1.3.32
the linux-kernel must be configured with IPX=Y.
ipx-interface and ipx-routes are setup by the program if the
entry 4 (devices) in the nw.ini file is filled.

=========>   stop programs (server down)
If nwserv isn't daemonized, then the server can be stopped
with ^C, otherwise the server must be shut down with a
kill of nwserv or with the right dos client programm
(fconsole server down) as supervisor. Entry 210 in the
nw.ini file gives the time in seconds, before the server
really shuts down.

Viel Erfolg / good Luck  :-)

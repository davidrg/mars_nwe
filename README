This is Mars_nwe, a free NetWare(tm) emulator for Linux and UnixWare,
written by Martin Stover, Marburg, Germany.

There is not yet too much documentation available, look into the doc/
subdirectory. As Martin's native tongue is german, the documentation,
as well as a lot of the code comments are a mixture of english and
german. This will certainly converge to english in the future.

INSTALLATION
look in doc/INSTALL or doc/INSTALL.ger

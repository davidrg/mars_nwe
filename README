This software is freely distributable under the GNU public license, a
copy of which you should have received with this software (in a file
called COPYING).


WHAT CAN MARS_NWE DO?
=====================

Here is a very short list of what mars_nwe can do for you.

- mars_nwe is a very functional clone of a NetWare server that runs
  under Linux. It works fine with the usual DOS client software that
  normally comes with your NetWare server.

- mars_nwe offers file, bindery and print services for NetWare client
  software.

- It was reported that if you patch your Linux kernel with the
  speed-enhancing patch in examples/, mars_nwe is slower than NetWare
  3.12, but FASTER THAN NetWare 4.1 on the same hardware.

- mars_nwe does not include any user license restrictions. You can
  increase mars_nwe's licenses by simply recompiling it, and you can
  start any number of mars_nwe's on your network!

- mars_nwe includes a RIP/SAP daemon that turns your Linux box into a
  fine IPX router.


Related packages include:

- mars_dosutils: Some utilities that should free you from having to
  use proprietary utilities when you want to use mars_nwe with DOS
  clients.

- ncpfs: a linux-only filesystem allowing you to mount volumes
  exported by NetWare servers on your linux box. This is included as
  standard with Linux 2.0 and later.


FTP SITE
========

Martin Stover has no online internet site. New versions are always
sent by uuencoded mail to Volker Lendecke, who puts them on
ftp.gwdg.de:/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs. sunsite mirrors this directory in
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/ncpfs.

HTTP SITE
=========

Http downloads are available under 'www.compu-art.de/download/mars_nwe.html'.
A homepage should be available under 'www.compu-art.de/mars_nwe/'.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

There is not yet too much documentation available, look into the doc/
subdirectory. As Martin's native tongue is german, the documentation,
as well as a lot of the code comments are a mixture of english and
german. This will certainly converge to english in the future. Feel
free to increase the rate of convergence, see above for patches!


INSTALLATION
============

look in doc/INSTALL or doc/INSTALL.ger


HELP
====

To get help you can mail to and/or subscribe to LinWare mailing list:

Topics for the list:
- discussing mars_nwe server, its features, installation problems and bugs
- using IPX protocol under Linux
- IPX routing and router daemons under Linux
- and, last but not least, the LinWare daemon

You can subscribe to the list by sending command "ADD linware" in mail
message body to address: "listserv@sh.cvut.cz".
Your list postings should be sent to address: "linware@sh.cvut.cz".


CONTRIBUTIONS
=============

If you want to contribute to the development of the software then
please join the mailing list.

Martin accept patches (preferably in "diff -u" format) and is
always glad to receive feedback or suggestions.

Remember that free software of this kind lives or dies by the response
we get. If noone tells us they like it then we'll probably move onto
something else.

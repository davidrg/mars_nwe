Marsmail is a pascal frontend for mail that translates the
unix mailfile into smaller files that pegasus mail understands.

Please examine all the files carefully as this is not a commercial
program suite, it's freeware. Written by staff/students for students..

what's new
----------
Lot's of automation....
Lot's of new ideas ie birthday reminders, expiry scripts etc etc
Better docs

Procedure:
----------
Take a deep breath and realize that there is no install script.
Make sure your mars is running successfully and dos users can log into
the server with normal novell client software. Make sure your directory 
layout for Mars looks simmular to the one listed in this document. Get a good
editor for linux to edit the scripts to suite your company's needs. Get
the pegasus mail program from one of it's mirror sites. Unpack and follow it's 
install method. DON't use pegasus's bindery features to fetch mail in the
SYS:\mail locations. This requires a mercury.nlm that cannot run on linux.
You can attempt using the pmpop utilities for dos to fetch mail via pop from
the server, (which might have been the best possible solution if it worked),
but there is a seperate project to edit the ini file on the fly for multiple
users....

Make sure you map drive I: to  the user's home directory (or change the
scripts). I've used a map root i:=sys:\home\%name% to do this in the
master mars login script that can be created with syscon.

Start by examining each script carefully - there is a lot of undocumented
features in them... Then start by editing the pmdflts.ini to suite your needs.
Use the one included as a template.  Read the pmail docs carefully. 

Link your unix mailboxes into your mars SYS 
volume space i.e. ln -s /var/spool/mail /home/SYS/unixmail
Run pconfig to create a user defined gateway. Mine looked like this:

Check if your  unixmail is secure i.e. mars users cannot read each others mail.
This can be done by loggin in from a dos box with different user names and
trying to view the sys:\unixmail\%name% files

Edit the pmail.bat to suite your needs. Make sure the drive mappings is correct.
i.e. I: maps to userdir. Compile the marsmail.pas to suite your needs if needed.
Test to see if you can read mail from pegasus and that the gateway places
outgoing messages in i:\pmail\out.

Edit the ohpostme scripts until it posts mail out for your users.
This can be tested by posting a message with pmail, seeing if a file is created
in i:\pmail\out, and waiting for ohpostme to visit the directory, removing and
posting the file.

Deploy (!) the ohmail and ohmessage scripts to run out of rc.local or however
you prefer. See if it notifies the user when new mail arrives.... You can
tail -f the log files to see what is happening. A note on samba notification:
the message gets sent to a machine instead of a user.

Decide if you want to use the new adduser script called ohmasteruser and 
nomasteruser for creating users and destroying users on a mars aware unix
server. MAKE BACKUPS of your original passwd files etc before continueing.
Note this new adduser creates /etc/expiry /etc/birthdays /etc/ohmyusers
/etc/ohmaillist

Remove users from ohmaillist to prevent them from mailing
Remove users from expiry to prevent account expiry
Remove users from birthdays to prevent birthday notification

Please note the change to passwd file: 

auser:x:505:512:A dummy user:/hamster/home/./auser:/etc/ftponly

The extra dot after home forces ftp to see this as the root, thus
allowing the ftp to enter ../httpd/html/auser via the link. Note that
/app or unixmail cannot be reached via ftp.

Edit your mars's net$log.dat in SYS:\public to exit to the extended login
script ohlogscr.bat that actually creates the users with a default password
on the mars server. Modify the wwwhomepage script to create homepages for
your new users.

You might need to either install quotas or remove mentioning of quotas from
the scripts. 

Customize the ohform.htm to your needs and decide if you would like to use it
as a user application form from the web. The apache server can run on the
same server as mars.... ohform.htm calls newuser.pl that creates a script file
to ease the user creation. newuser.pl sends mail to admin user to inform him
of the new application.


These scripts can handle shadow passwords. Create a blank file /etc/ftponly
and use this dummy shell for users to prevent them from telnetting to the
server. Mail fetching via pop and ftp will continue to work.

Suggested directory structure for good operation...

/apps
/base
/base/SYS			(mars server SYS volume)
/base/SYS/unixmail      	ln -s /var/spool/mail /base/SYS/unixmail
/base/SYS/apps			ln -s /apps /base/SYS/apps
/base/SYS/home			ln -s ../home home
/base/home			base home directories
/base/home/auser		(Yip, the user's home dir)
/base/home/auser/www		ln -s ../httpd/html/dummyuser www
/base/home/auser/pmail		gets created from /etc/skel used for pmail
/base/home/httpd/html		Web server root space
/base/home/httpd/html/main	non-user related space.
/base/home/httpd/html/auser	(user's www space)

You can now even share the apps, home dirs and unixmail with samba and you've 
got a complete novell and nt server all in one, sharing the same space!

If you find ANY errors with this doc or missing files please let me know...

The marsmail is just a dirty hack to satisfy the dos users. Stick with
pop3 or imap to fetch mail via tcpip from win95, os2, wfw, linux and other.
The other stuff included with marsmail is just to automate as much as possible 
for our poor overworked netadmins!
